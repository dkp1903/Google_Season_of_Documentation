## Pointers

* Refactoring for improved code clarity, paying down technical debt.

* Profiling model runs to establish performance benchmarks.

* Improved (standardised?) metadata format to enable spatial outputs with attribute tables.

* Improved accessibility for less technical users. Simplified installation. Possibly pre-configured sets of modules to reduce complexity.

* Pre- and post-processing functions + resources for analytic capability development of external organisations, particularly reporting and visualisation.

* Best use case for spatial models is planning. Can we couple projections with policy making?

* Improved uncertainty analysis.

* Agnostic framework for “spatialising” and scaling pet models (e.g. DAYCENT) - FLINT as “the scaling tool”

* Best-practice guides and configuration for for scaling inputs + outputs to next-gen remote sensing data and model complexity, including optimised performance.

* Synthesis and aggregation of model values when working with supra-individual scales (30cm)  or daily temporal resolution [possibly core 3.0] 

* How do we enable statistically ‘learning’ models (aka ‘online models’ or ‘checkpointing’) for adaptive forecasting - updating projections as new data become available.
